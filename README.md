# TS-GAN
The implementation of conditional GAN for the prediction of the transition state (TS) geometry based on cartesian coordinates of product and reactant.
For more information, please refer [here](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0055094) to our publication.

### Note form developer
This is an updated version of the TS-GAN. Here, I am including the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) and the newest version of Tensorflow (2.12) to speed up the prediction code. 

### Prerequisites:
* Python 3.9.16
* Tensorflow 2.12.0
* Numpy 1.23.0

### Installation:
Go to the working directory:

        git clone https://github.com/ekraka/TS-GAN.git

### Prediction
To predict the TS guess structure, make sure the `g_model.h5` file is in the same working directory as `xyz` files of reactant and product. 
The `g_model.h5` can be found in the `test_cases` folder depending on which reaction one is interested in.

    python path/ts_gan/TS_GAN.py reactant.xyz product.xyz
    
The example script: `run_tsgan.py`.
TS_GAN will generate two files: `temp_ts.xyz` and `temp_mov.xyz`. The first file shows the final guess structure, while the second file shows the trajectory of how the optimization took place. 

### Training
To train the model on your own data, convert `xyz` files of reactants, transition states, and products into the Coulomb matrices (CMs) and store as numpy file. This can be done with the gen_data.py script which requires specific format for files. The reactnats, transition states and products should be kept in a single folder with the following name specification:

        Transition state: filename.xyz
        Reactant: filename_rev.xyz
        Product: filename_for.xyz

To create the numpy data, run the following command from this directory:

        python path/ts_gan/gen_data.py
        
This will create a file called data.npy

To train through this data, create a prefered working directory and copy the data.npy file. Also, create an empty folder `temp` in this directory, then run:

    python train.py 

During the training process, the model will save weights of discriminator and generator as `d_model.h5` and `g_model.h5`, respectively. While the random real and fake samples of the CMs are saved in the `temp` folder. 

### Test
To calculate the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) use:

        python align3D.py real_ts.xyz temp_ts.xyz
